   - If low then clicks poition or just runs outside and gets health and mana that way

also add a catch in state 4 that checks if the player has moved from the room yet
   - add a transition checker and if not triggered then try movement again
Add functionality to start the program using the F7 key while in game
   - This could also be used to pause the program
add stats for each of the states to get an idea of how long the bot is expected to be in each
Have an automatically stat generating device that shows the above on a graph.
